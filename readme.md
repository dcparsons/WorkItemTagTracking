# TFS Work Item Tag Tracking

As of Team Foundation Server 2018 there is no way to be notified when a work item either has a given tag applied to it or when a given tag is removed from a work item. This utility uses the [TFS APIs](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/integrate/api/overview) to get a set of tags for a given Team Project and associated work items.
